Analysis
There are litteraly milions of games out there that are better than my game in functionality and entertainment,
however my code offer several code examples of different functionality. 
This game is far from complete but got great potential to show a thing or two to newbie HTML5 Canvas and JS coders.

Here are some of the competition (some of whom I have learnt a great deal from):

HTML5 game tutorial â€“ Make a snake game using HTML5 Canvas and jQuery

Make a particle system in HTML 5 Canvas

Not any of these "games" are entertaining (at least not for long) but they all have a great deal of good code solution to teach, that is easily applied on seperate projects.
